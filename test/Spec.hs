{-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF hspec-discover #-}
{-|
  This instructs GHC to invoke hspec-discover as a preprocessor on the source file.
  The rest of the source file is empty, so there is nothing to preprocess.
  Rather than preprocessing, hspec-discover scans the file system for all spec files belonging
  to a project and generates the required boilerplate. hspec-discover does not parse any source files,
  it instead relies on the following conventions:

  Spec files have to be placed into the same directory as the test driver, or into a subdirectory.
  The name of a spec file has to end in Spec.hs; the module name has to match the file name.
  Each spec file has to export a top-level binding spec of type Spec.
